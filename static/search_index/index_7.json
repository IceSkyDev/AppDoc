Introduce The TCP data forwarding tool supports connecting the TCP server and the client at the receiver, supports the TCP server, the TCP client, MQTT and Websocket at the forwarding destination, and supports custom mapping to forward data. ## How to use The interface is divided into two parts, the left side is receive area, which is used to connect the source of the data; The right side is send area, which is used to connect to the destination of data sending. ### Data Forward Settings ![](../assets/images/TestTools/TCPForward1.png) 1. Config receiver 1. Select the receiver connection type * The available connection types for the receiver are TCP Server and TCP Client * The TCP server is used to receive data sent by other TCP clients, and the TCP client is used to receive data from the TCP server to which it is connected 2. Connect the receiver * Enter the server IP and port in the text box * For TCP servers, you do not need to change the IP address, but can keep the default value of 127.0.0.1 * After the parameters are set, click the [Start] button at the bottom, and the button will change to [Stop] after success 3. Stop the receiver * Click the [Stop] button to stop 2. Configure sender 1. Select the sender connection type * In addition to TCP Server and TCP Client, you can also select MQTT and WebSocket for the sender * A TCP server broadcasts the received data to all clients connected to the server > Use this way, you can forward multiple destination TCP clients * A TCP client can send the received data to the server to which it is connected * MQTT sends the received data with specified topic * Websoctor will send the received data to the specified Path 2. Connect the sender * For TCP Server and TCP Client, the connection way is the same as that of the receiver * In addition to specifying the IP and port, you also need to specify the sending topic and Qos to connect to MQTT, and the username and password can be specified as needed * In addition to specifying the IP and port, you can also specify the path, username, and password as needed to connect to a websocket * After the parameters are set, click the [Start] button at the bottom, and the button will change to [Stop] after success 3. Stop the sender * Click the [Stop] button to stop 3.
