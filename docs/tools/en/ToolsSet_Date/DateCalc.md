## How to use

The interface is divided into three parts, the left side can be used for the solar date and time shift and date time interval calculation, the middle can be used for the lunar date and time shift and the eight-character to solar calendar, and the right side can be used for various datetime conversions

* solar date and time shift
  1. Set start date and time
    
     Enter or select start time in the date and time input box above

* Datetime interval calculation
  1. Start time

     The start time is the time set by the input above

  2. End time
     
     Enter the end time in the text box below

  3. Calculate result

     Click the calculation button on the right to calculate the time interval, and use color to distinguish the positive and negative time differences, which can automatically convert units
