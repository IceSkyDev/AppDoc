  > A certain number of mines are randomly placed in the grid, and the player flips through the blocks one by one to find all the mines as the final game goal. If the player flips over a block with mines, the game is over. If a number appears on a block, the number indicates the number of mines in the 3Ã—3 area around it, and the player needs to deduce the location of the mines based on the numbers and mark them.
